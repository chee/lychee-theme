# lychee
a theme by chee

lychee for emacs is a theme for emacs, written by chee.

it is called lychee because it is cute and and tasty.

lychee theme has only been tested under emacs 24.

it uses `deftheme`, so you just wanna download it and stick it in `~/.emacs.d/themes`, then add this to your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
```

evaluate that or restart emacs and `M-x load-theme <RET> lychee`

and omg now it looks like this:
